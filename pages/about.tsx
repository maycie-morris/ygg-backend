            The story of Yield Guild Games tracks back to 2018, when gaming
            industry veteran Gabby Dizon began to lend his own Axies to other
            Axie Infinity players who couldnâ€™t afford to buy their own. By
            October 2020, it was clear how this was helping Filipinos create
            another source of income during the pandemic while doing something
            they enjoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It sparked the idea to create a global network of players and
            investors who would help each other get started with NFT games. With
            fintech entrepreneur Beryl Li and developer Owl of Moistness joining
            Gabby as co-founders, YGG was brought to life with the mission of
            onboarding millions of people into the play-to-earn revolution.
